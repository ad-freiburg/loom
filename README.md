LOOM
====

Software suite for the automated generation of geographically correct or schematic transit maps.

Based on our work in the following papers:

A pipeline for generating geographically accurate transit maps which appears to be similar to ours was described by Anton Dubrau in a [blog post](https://blog.transitapp.com/how-we-built-the-worlds-prettiest-auto-generated-transit-maps-12d0c6fa502f).

Also see our web demos [here](https://loom.cs.uni-freiburg.de/), [here](https://loom.cs.uni-freiburg.de/global), and [here](https://octi.cs.uni-freiburg.de).

Requirements
------------

 * `cmake`
 * `gcc >= 5.0` (or `clang >= 3.9`)
 * Optional: `libglpk-dev`, `coinor-libcbc-dev`, `gurobi`, `libzip-dev`, `libprotobuf-dev`


Building and Installation
-------------------------

Fetch this repository and init submodules:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ad-freiburg/loom.git
```

Build and install:

```bash
cd loom
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j
```

To (optionally) install, type
```bash
make install
```

You can also use the binaries in `./build` directly.

Usage
=====

This suite consists of several tools:

* `gtfs2graph`, create a GeoJSON line graph from GTFS data
* `topo`, create an overlapping-free line graph from an arbitrary line graph
* `loom`, find optimal line orderings on a line graph
* `octi`, create a schematic version of a line graph
* `transitmap`, render a line graph into an SVG map (`--render-engine=svg`) or into vector tiles (`--render-engine=mvt`)

All tools output a graph, in the GeoJSON format, to `stdout`, and expect a GeoJSON graph at `stdin`. Exceptions are `gtfs2graph`, where the input is a GTFS feed, and `transitmap`, which writes SVG to `stdout` or MVT vector tiles to a specified folder.

The `example` folder contains several overlapping-free line graphs.

To render the geographically correct Stuttgart map from above, use
```bash
cat examples/stuttgart.json | loom | transitmap > stuttgart.svg
```

To also render labels, use

```bash
cat examples/stuttgart.json | loom | transitmap -l > stuttgart-label.svg
```

To render an *octilinear* map, put the `octi` tool into the pipe:

```bash
cat examples/stuttgart.json | loom | octi | transitmap -l > stuttgart-octilin.svg
```

To render for example the orthoradial map from above, use a different base graph for `octi`:

```bash
cat examples/stuttgart.json | loom | octi -b orthoradial | transitmap -l > stuttgart-orthorad.svg
```

Line graph extraction from GTFS
-------------------------------

Help command to get parameters

```bash
gtfs2graph --help
```

To extract for example a line graph for streetcars from GTFS data, use `gtfs2graph` as follows:

```bash
gtfs2graph -m tram freiburg.zip > freiburg.json
```

This line graph will have many overlapping edges and stations. To create an overlapping-free line graph ready for rendering, add `topo`:

```bash
gtfs2graph -m tram freiburg.zip | topo > freiburg.json
```

A full pipeline for creating an octilinear map of the Freiburg tram network would look like this:

```bash
gtfs2graph -m tram freiburg.zip | topo | loom | octi | transitmap > freiburg-tram.svg
```

Usage via Docker
================

You can also use any tool in a Docker container via the provided Dockerfile.

To build the container:

```bash
docker build -t loom
```

To run a tool from the suite, use

```bash
docker run -i loom <TOOL>
```
***Example:***

```bash
docker run -i loom gtfs2graph --help
```

For example, to octilinearize the Freiburg example, use

```bash
cat examples/freiburg.json | sudo docker run -i loom octi
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to use gurobi for ILP optimization, you *must* mount a folder container a valid gurobi license file `gurobi.lic` to `/gurobi/` in the container. For example, if your `gurobi.lic` is in `/home/user/gurobi`:

```bash
docker run -v /home/user/gurobi:/gurobi loom <TOOL>
```
